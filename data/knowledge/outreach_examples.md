## linkedin connection notes (3 variants)

note 1 — research opener
hi {{first_name}} — i’m researching how boutique agencies like {{agency}} handle ops complexity (brief → approval → delivery). would love to compare notes and share what i’m seeing across shops your size. – andrew

note 2 — pain-led
hi {{first_name}} — quick question: what’s the hardest part of your current workflow: intake, approvals, or handoffs? i help small teams systematize these in 2–4 weeks. open to a brief chat? – andrew

note 3 — value-first
hi {{first_name}} — i’m mapping repeatable fixes for agencies (5–25 ppl) to reduce revision churn and missed deadlines. have 3 patterns that might help {{agency}} right away. connect?

## linkedin follow-up (after accept)
thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}. if useful, i can share a 2-week assessment outline that’s worked for teams your size (interviews, process map, prioritized actions). no deck, just the plan. want me to send it?

## quick pitch dm (when they say “sure”)
great — here’s the skinny:
- 2 weeks, 3–5 interviews, current-state map
- prioritized action plan (people, process, tools)
- ready-to-use templates for approvals + handoffs
investment: $8.5k all-in. if you want, we can also walk through a recent example. want to pick a 20-min slot?

## email — cold (short)
