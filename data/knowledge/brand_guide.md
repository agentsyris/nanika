# brand guide — syris. / calm. family

architecture
- parent: syris. (systematic solutions for modern life)
- products:
  - calm.ops — b2b systematic business operations
  - calm.life — b2c systematic personal transformation
  - future options: calm.mind, calm.daily, calm.teams, calm.money (do not use unless asked)

positioning
- we design and implement systems that turn chaotic work or life into calm, repeatable outcomes.
- we prioritize speed-to-value, practical implementation, and measurable evidence.

audiences
- calm.ops (initial focus):
  - boutique creative agencies (5–25 ppl) for pilots and fast wins
  - mid-market teams (50–500 ppl) for full-price services and scale
- calm.life (parallel build): individuals seeking systematic personal transformation

core narratives
- chaos → calm, systematically.
- evidence over opinions: every deliverable should have an artifact path and a measurable impact statement.
- small steps shipped daily outperform giant plans not executed.

visual + naming
- all lowercase. trailing period in product names.
- minimal layouts, generous spacing, no heavy decoration.

calls to action
- “book a 20-min discovery call”
- “start with a 2-week assessment”
- “get the first 3 action steps”

guardrails
- never over-promise; anchor deliverables to timeboxed sprints and explicit scopes.
- always include a next step the reader can take now.
