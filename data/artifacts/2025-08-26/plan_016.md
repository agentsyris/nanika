here's a 2-step plan for this scheduled test:

1. **review existing notes**: scan through our lessons learned and kpi map to identify any patterns or insights that might inform our next steps.
2. **draft a tiny note**: create a brief note (like this one) that summarizes the outcome of step 1, along with any recommended actions or next steps.

**tiny note draft:**

- reviewed lessons learned from previous weeks
- no major new insights, but some minor tweaks to linkedin outreach approach appear promising
- will test these adjustments in upcoming campaigns and report back on results
