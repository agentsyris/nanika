here's the 2-step plan for this test:

• confirm that i understand the task correctly and have all required context.
• create a tiny note with a concrete call to action.

next step: draft the tiny note below.

tiny note:
"test confirmed. next step: review context and provide feedback on tone, structure, and content."
