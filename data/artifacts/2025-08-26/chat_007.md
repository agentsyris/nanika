i'd be happy to grant you a wish. however, i need to make it a bit more specific and actionable.

here's what i'll do:

* i'll give you 3 options for wishes that are concrete and achievable.
* you pick one that resonates with you the most.
* we'll break down the chosen wish into smaller, manageable steps.

option 1: "i wish to have a more organized workspace."
option 2: "i wish to start a daily habit of journaling."
option 3: "i wish to learn a new skill in the next 30 days."

which option do you want to choose?
