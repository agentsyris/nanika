here's the 3-step plan for this tiny note:

1. **acknowledge**: confirm that this is a scheduled test and that we're on track.
2. **clarify scope**: verify that no actual work or deliverables are expected from this test.
3. **next step**: propose scheduling a follow-up to discuss actual projects or tasks.

that's it for now!
