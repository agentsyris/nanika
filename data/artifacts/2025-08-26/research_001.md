**research summary**

to clarify, you'd like me to review your interview notes and extract 3 key pain points along with a defined scope.

here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **review notes**: i'll carefully read through the interview notes.
2. **identify pain points**: using a systematic approach, i'll categorize and prioritize the discussed challenges into top 3 pain points.
3. **define scope**: based on the identified pain points, i'll outline a clear scope for further investigation.

**assumptions**:
- your interview notes are concise and to-the-point.
- the goal is to identify actionable pain points rather than theoretical concerns.

**proposed scope**:

to ensure we're aligned, please confirm if this approach meets your expectations. 

(once confirmed, i'll proceed with summarizing the notes into 3 pain points and a defined scope)
