here is a 6-step plan to secure 1 calm.ops pilot in the next 24 hours:

**step 1: identify potential pilots**
review andrew's existing network on linkedin (max. 30 minutes).
 capture names of 5 individuals who fit the pilot profile.

**step 2: craft linkedin note**
write a concise, personalized note to each identified individual.
template:
"hi [first name], 
interested in exploring how calm.ops can support your workflow?
would love to schedule a quick call to discuss further."

**example linkedin note:**

"hi emily, 
interested in exploring how calm.ops can support your workflow?
would love to schedule a quick call to discuss further.
best,
andrew"

**step 3: send linkedin notes**
send the crafted notes to all 5 individuals (max. 10 minutes).

**step 4: create follow-up email template**
write a simple, lowercase follow-up email template:
"hi [first name],
wanted to follow up on my linkedin note from earlier.
still interested in exploring how calm.ops can support your workflow?
best,
andrew"

**example follow-up email:**

"hi emily,
wanted to follow up on my linkedin note from earlier.
still interested in exploring how calm.ops can support your workflow?
best,
andrew"

**step 5: schedule follow-up emails**
schedule the follow-up email to be sent to each individual in 4 hours (max. 10 minutes).

**step 6: review responses and next steps**
review any responses from potential pilots within the next 20 hours.
 capture decisions + rationale briefly:
    - if positive response, schedule a call to discuss further.
    - if negative or no response, remove from pilot consideration.

next actions will be obvious based on the responses received.
