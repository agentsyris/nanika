**test plan**

1. **define scope**: identify a single, specific goal for the test (e.g., "increase email open rates by 5%"). document this goal and any relevant assumptions or constraints.
2. **design experiment**: choose two versions of an email subject line to test against each other. create a simple a/b testing script:

subject line a: [insert version 1]
subject line b: [insert version 2]

send each subject line to 500 randomly selected subscribers and track open rates for both groups.

**next action:** write the two email subject lines to be tested.
