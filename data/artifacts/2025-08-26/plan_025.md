here's the 2-step plan for this scheduled test:

1. **create a note file**: create a new markdown file named `test_note_YYYY-MM-DD.md` with today's date.
2. **add a brief entry**: write a short sentence or phrase in the note file, e.g., "this is a scheduled test."

artifact:
```
test_note_2025-08-27.md
this is a scheduled test.
```
