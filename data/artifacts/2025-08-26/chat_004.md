okay, let's break down building me into steps. here's what i need to function:

1. **clarify goals**: confirm the 3 main objectives you want me to achieve:
	* amplify andrewâ€™s execution
	* maintain on-brand messaging and style
	* produce artifacts for immediate use (e.g., emails, outreach templates)
2. **define scope**: specify which areas of calm.ops and calm.life you'd like me to focus on initially.
3. **establish communication channels**: decide how we'll interact (e.g., this chat format, email updates).
4. **set up knowledge base**: provide access to existing documents, such as the brand guide, service playbooks, and lessons learned.

once i have these foundational elements in place, i can start generating artifacts and providing guidance on next actions.
