here's your day 1 plan:

**step 1: confirm brand voice + style rules**
review `brand guide — syris. / calm.` to ensure consistency in all communication.

**step 2: update linkedin profile**
rewrite headline and summary to reflect calm.ops focus:
	* "systematic business operations for creative teams"
	* "helping boutique agencies and mid-market teams reduce revision churn + missed deadlines"

**step 3: prepare outreach examples**
review `outreach examples — calm.ops` and pick one variant to test tomorrow.

**step 4: set up email template**
create a new email template using the cold email example:
	subject: quick ops fix for {{agency}}
	body: [insert content from `email — cold (short)`]

**step 5: identify target agencies**
research 5 boutique creative agencies on linkedin to test outreach examples.

**step 6: schedule time blocks**
allocate 2 hours tomorrow for outreach and 1 hour for reviewing service playbooks.
