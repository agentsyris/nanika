here is your 3-step plan for tomorrow's outreach:

**step 1: research and list**
open a new note in your minimal notes app. title it "tomorrow's outreach". write down:
	* 5 companies that align with our current goals
	* 2-3 key contacts at each company (use crunchbase or linkedin)
	* 1 relevant, recent news article or update about each company

**step 2: craft email template**
create a new draft in your email client. write a brief, personalized outreach email that:
	* mentions the recent news article/update
	* clearly states our value proposition (keep it concise)
	* requests a call/meeting to discuss further
save this as a template for reuse

**step 3: send and track**
send the templated email to each contact on your list. cc yourself on each email. use a simple spreadsheet or note to track:
	* date sent
	* company/contact info
	* follow-up status (yes/no)

ready to execute.
