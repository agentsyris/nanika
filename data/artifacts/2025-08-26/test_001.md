here are three bullet points for a creative director outreach:

• we help small teams like yours systematize intake → approvals → delivery in 2–4 weeks. want to share our 2-week assessment outline?
• i've worked with similar shops to reduce revision churn and missed deadlines by 30%. would you be open to a quick call to explore how we can do the same for your team?
• looking for practical templates to streamline your workflow? we've got ready-to-use briefs, approvals, and handoffs that you can use today. want me to send them over?
