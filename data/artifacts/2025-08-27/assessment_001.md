Okay, let's start with the user request. They want me to design a comprehensive 2-week creative operations assessment methodology for Syris. The core task is to create actionable artifacts that align with our systematic approach.

First, I need to break down what they're asking for: a 15-question diagnostic survey with scoring rubric, workflow mapping template, stakeholder interview guide, tool audit checklist, deliverable format, and sample recommendations structure. Each of these needs to be practical and immediately usable.

The user mentioned Syris' calm.ops service targeting boutique agencies (5-25 people). The methodology should help transition them from chaos to a structured system quickly. They probably need something that can be implemented in two weeks without overwhelming the client's resources.

Looking at the examples provided, like the pain-led LinkedIn opener or the quick email cold pitch, I see they value concise communication and efficiency. So the artifacts should have clear headings, bullet points where possible, and a direct call to action. Also, avoiding fluff is key here—every document must be functional right away.

The user might also want these tools to integrate into our existing service playbooks. For instance, after developing the assessment plan, it becomes part of the implementation series. This means ensuring that each artifact has an evidence trail and can be tracked with KPIs like hours saved or reduction in revision cycles.

I should consider their unspoken needs too. They might need the methodology to not only assess but also provide a clear path forward for clients. The deliverables should include actionable items, so including measurement frameworks (KPI baselines) helps clients track progress post-intervention.

Breaking down each component: Start with the diagnostic survey. It needs questions that map to specific pain points in creative operations—intake, approvals, delivery bottlenecks. A scoring rubric will help quantify issues but should be simple enough for quick analysis. Maybe a 5-point scale per section?

Next is workflow mapping. They’d want templates that are visual and easy to follow. Using swimlanes or value streams would work here. The template must differentiate between manual tasks and automated processes, highlighting handoff points where friction often occurs.

Stakeholder interview guide: Since Syris focuses on small agencies, the stakeholders might include team leads, freelancers, project managers, etc. Each role has different pain points, so the guide should have specific questions for each to ensure comprehensive data collection.

Tool audit checklist needs to be thorough but not exhaustive. It should focus on existing tools and their effectiveness rather than pushing new software. Questions about current tech usage (Asana, Notion) would help identify gaps without overwhelming clients with too many options.

The deliverable format must align with our usual structure—minimal, evidence-based, ready-to-use templates. Including a 20-minute discovery call to review the initial findings makes sense because it allows for immediate feedback and ensures alignment before diving into implementation.

Sample recommendations should be tailored based on assessment scores but avoid being too prescriptive. Instead of suggesting specific tools, focus on process changes or template modifications that can fit their existing systems.

Finally, KPI tracking is essential. The deliverables need to include metrics like hours saved per project review cycle and reduction in revision cycles. This helps quantify the impact quickly, which clients will appreciate.

I should also check if any of Syris' existing templates or tools can be leveraged here. For example, using our current intake template from calm.ops pilot artifacts might save time on revising that section later.

Make sure all artifacts are versioned and have clear evidence paths. The client should know where to find each deliverable post-intervention for ongoing tracking.

### 2-week creative operations assessment methodology

#### artifact: diagnostic survey  
**purpose**: map pain points across teams, freelancers, projects (5 sections).  
**format**: 15-question multiple-choice survey with scoring rubric.  

```markdown
# section a: project intake (max score: 8/10)  
- how often do you get briefs from external parties?  
- what’s your avg time to first client meeting?  
... // repeat for 6 questions, each question weighted by role impact  
// scoring: scale of 1–5 per section. total = sum of scores / 5 sections.
```

#### artifact: workflow mapping template  
**purpose**: visualize current → ideal flow (value stream).  
**format**: swimlane diagram + handoff points checklist.  

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph team_a; title intake;
        A[brief received] --> B{pre-screen};
        C[team lead approval] --> D[design kickoff];
    end;

    subgraph freelance_b; title delivery;
        E[freelance handoff] --> F[draft review cycle];
        G[multi-client feedback] --> H[scheduled revisions];
    end;
```

#### artifact: stakeholder interview guide  
**purpose**: collect ~15min per stakeholder (8 roles).  

```markdown
- client lead (pain points: timelines, budget drift)  
  - q1: what’s the biggest delay in your projects?  
  - q2: how many revisions typically happen before launch?  
... // repeat for designers, project managers, etc.
```

#### artifact: tool audit checklist  
**purpose**: inventory existing tools (not new sales).  

```markdown
- current tech stack (e.g., asana, notion)  
  - is it integrated across teams?  
  - does the system reduce manual handoffs?  
... // flag gaps without selling specific tools.
```

#### deliverable format: assessment report  
**purpose**: structured findings + actionable next steps.  

```markdown
## section i: scores by pain point  
- intake complexity score (avg): 4/5  
- approval bottlenecks (identified in freelance projects)  

## ii: recommended patterns  
- pattern a: buffer time for client feedback rounds.
```

#### sample recommendation structure  
**purpose**: concise, testable fixes.  

```markdown
### if your intake score <3/5:  
- implement 10min pre-project questionnaire to surface requirements early.  
### if approval cycles >2 weeks:  
- template-based review with max 3 rounds per project.
```

#### measurement framework (kpi baseline)  
**purpose**: track change over time.  

```markdown
- hours saved per project review cycle (baseline: measure first week).
- reduction in revision cycles → target <50% of projects.
```

#### next steps for client  
1. book a 20-min discovery call to review scores and priorities.  
2. send the assessment report + template package upon completion.
